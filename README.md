# BluetoothLeConnect

This is the code I used to create an android BLE application (since I am new to this most of it is from the source code BluetoothLeGatt on android). I have made some changes such as getting rid of all the Heart Rate code, adding LED control code (write bytes to turn on/off an LED) and added feedback to change a TextView into light on/light off whenever the actual like changes state. I have also gotten rid of the listview for services and characteristics as I plan to change it around a bit so that the code can connect to multiple BLE devices.
